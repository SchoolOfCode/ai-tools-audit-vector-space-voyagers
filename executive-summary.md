# Executive Summary

We have surveyed the following AI tools to assess their benefits for productivity: 

- Otter.ai
- Github co-pilot
- Mistral
- Intercom


We've found that all of these products pose significant benefits for productivity and performance at TechForge. For instance:

## Otter.ai

Otter is an AI-powered meeting notes generator, which captures key points and action items from video-call meetings. It provides captions for accessibility and meeting summaries to allow attendees to get clear action points and double-check what's been agreed afterwards. It boasts a wide range of integrations, so it works with Slack, Microsoft office/teams and Google drive. 

A drawback could be that it doesn't currently integrate with Github projects, which means it wouldn't allow users to quickly generate Github projects, milestones and issues based on decisions in meetings. Given the tech-first and collaborative culture at TechForge, this would mean some manual work for our Engineers, and so  lessens the potential positive impact of Otter on our Engineering teams. 

## Github co-pilot

Github co-pilot is an AI-powered chatbot that integrates with your IDE. It can suggest code in your code files and your commands to run in the terminal. It can explain new technical concepts, offer feedback on how to improve code quality (readability, scalability, security etc.) and since it is pre-trained on industry standards, it offers reliable industry-standard best pratices. 

A drawback is the cost of co-pilot for our developer team (100 people). Co-pilot costs 10 USD per person per month. Also, it would not benefit the other non-technical employees (150 people). There are also privacy concerns; it infers from existing code in your codebase, which there are concerns about sharing.
