![aitools1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59a8869a-6ad0-4774-9cf4-101e0dd59edf)

**Techforge** needs your expertise to identify AI tools that can benefit the company. This is where you'll compile and share your full audit report, collaborating as a team to deliver insights that will shape Techforge's future!

## 📋 Here's What to Do:

1. **Create a new markdown file** for each AI tool that you evaluate. We suggest possibly using any of the areas of evaluation mentioned in the task brief.
      - Opportunity
      - Risk
      - Tangible Benefit
      - Evaluation
2. After you've completed all of the audits, you will **Compile The Report** in this file. Delete everything here, and then write your:
      - Executive Summary
      - Introduction
      - Conclusion and Recommendations
3. Discuss and **choose AI tools** as a team, and evaluate them across whichever key areas you feel is best suited.
4. **Collaborate** as a team to ensure your findings are thorough and cover all necessary aspects.
5. Once you're satisfied with your findings, **'Commit changes'** to the main branch of the repository.
6. Your team members can then **present your findings** individually or as a team based on the markdown reports.

### 🌟 What’s Next?

As you explore the different AI tools, remember this is a **collaborative effort**—each contribution builds the final audit report. Your task is not only to analyze the tools but to discuss and collaborate as a team, bringing the best insights forward.

### 🛠 Tools and Resources:
- **Markdown**: Use markdown to structure your reports clearly.

🚨 **Important**: All findings must be submitted in the main branch. Make sure your team members are on the same page and coordinating well!

👩‍💻 **Happy Auditing!**


### Mistral

## Opportunity
Allows for quick and easy code that it can create and write, along side other forms of writing such as essays and reports. This means it can be used to not only program a site, but to create information to be displayed on the site

## Risk
Risks of Mistral are that it may not be able to create the code that is needed, or that it may not be able to create the information in a way that is useful to the user

## Tangible effects
Tangible effects of Mistral are that it is effective with saving time when creating software. Being a payed software, it charges for usage by providing tokens when the API is used, meaning it can be good for small usages, but if used a large amount, the cost could go over what the company could afford

## Evaluation
For Mistral, the benefits deffinitely outweigh the risks, since it is seen as a reliable tool in the creation of code and software. From what has been shown, it deffinitely seems like something to reccomend to programers and web developers



### Gemini

## Opportunity
