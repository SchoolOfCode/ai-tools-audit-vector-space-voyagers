### Mistral

## Opportunity
Allows for quick and easy code that it can create and write, along side other forms of writing such as essays and reports. This means it can be used to not only program a site, but to create information to be displayed on the site.
Mistral also allows for a veriety of languages to be used, such as Python, Java, and more, being a huge help for a variety of companies if they all use different languages.

## Risk
Risks of Mistral are that it may not be able to create the code that is needed, or that it may not be able to create the information in a way that is useful to the user. Another risk is that it may not be able to create the code in a way that is secure, or that it may not be able to create the code in a way that is reliable. Something else about Mistral is that it has no clear accessibility features, meaning that it may not be able to create the code in a way that is accessible to all users.

## Tangible effects
Tangible effects of Mistral are that it is effective with saving time when creating software. Being a payed software, it charges for usage by providing tokens when the API is used, meaning it can be good for small usages, but if used a large amount, the cost could go over what the company could afford. A positibe tangible effect is that it is a reliable tool for code creation, being able to create code that is both secure and reliable.

## Evaluation
For Mistral, the benefits deffinitely outweigh the risks, since it is seen as a reliable tool in the creation of code and software. From what has been shown, it deffinitely seems like something to reccomend to programers and web developers.
