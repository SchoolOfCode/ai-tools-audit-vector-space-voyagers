### Mistral

## Opportunity
Allows for quick and easy code that it can create and write, along side other forms of writing such as essays and reports. This means it can be used to not only program a site, but to create information to be displayed on the site

## Risk
Risks of Mistral are that it may not be able to create the code that is needed, or that it may not be able to create the information in a way that is useful to the user

## Tangible effects
Tangible effects of Mistral are that it is effective with saving time when creating software. Being a payed software, it charges for usage by providing tokens when the API is used, meaning it can be good for small usages, but if used a large amount, the cost could go over what the company could afford

## Evaluation
For Mistral, the benefits deffinitely outweigh the risks, since it is seen as a reliable tool in the creation of code and software. From what has been shown, it deffinitely seems like something to reccomend to programers and web developers
