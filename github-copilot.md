# Github Copilot

## Opportunity

Github Copilot speeds up the process of coding within the editor. It constantly reads your code and provides auto-completion suggestions. For boilerplate code, as in the code that only scaffolds the work needed before adding your unique business logic, it will help you well. For example, React code uses a component structure, and writing the functional component skeleton every time can be time-consuming.

## Risk

The potential downside of Copilot is that it can sometimes suggest perfect or bad code. Knowing between the two can confuse developers as it might introduce extra work thus making the coding process ironically longer. There might be privacy concerns also since it infers from existing code to suggest improvements. There is also the fact it costs money, $10 per seat. Techforge has 250 people and 100 of them might contribute to their product's source code. That will cost them $10,000 per month.

## Tangible Benefits

Saving time is the main benefit but using Copilot to ask for hints about an error is a great way to use it too. Also, most of the code completion by Copilot follows industry practices. If the team has a particular code style, you can tell it to adhere to those styles in a prompt. The biggest benefit overall is that it lets you focus on high level problem solving tasks and not worry too much about syntax and other details.

## Evaluation

Overall Github Copilot can be a valuable tool for companies look to improve their development efficiency, code quality and time-to-market. We recommend that they use it as the benefits outweigh the monthly cost.
